# Lipinski Rule of Five Calculator

A Python tool to calculate Lipinski's Rule of Five properties for chemical compounds from SMILES strings.

## Features

- Calculates key drug-likeness properties:
  - Molecular Weight (MW)
  - LogP (Octanol-water partition coefficient)
  - Hydrogen Bond Donors (HBD)
  - Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (HBA)
- Determines compliance with Lipinski's Rule of Five
- Handles large datasets efficiently
- Generates comprehensive CSV output
- Provides summary statistics
